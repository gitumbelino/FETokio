what is a logical operator?
Logical operators are symbols or words used in programming to connect two or more expressions or conditions. These operators are crucial in making decisions and controlling the flow of a program. Here are the primary logical operators in JavaScript:

1. && (Logical AND)
Usage: Combines two conditions and returns true only if both conditions are true.

Example:

javascript
let a = true;
let b = true;
console.log(a && b); // Output: true

let c = false;
console.log(a && c); // Output: false
2. || (Logical OR)
Usage: Combines two conditions and returns true if at least one of the conditions is true.

Example:

javascript
let a = true;
let b = false;
console.log(a || b); // Output: true

let c = false;
console.log(b || c); // Output: false
3. ! (Logical NOT)
Usage: Reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, ! will make it false, and vice versa.

Example:

javascript
let a = true;
console.log(!a); // Output: false

let b = false;
console.log(!b); // Output: true
4. Combining Logical Operators
You can combine multiple logical operators to create complex conditions.

Example:

javascript
let a = true;
let b = false;
let c = true;

console.log((a && b) || c); // Output: true
Use Case in Conditional Statements
Logical operators are often used in if statements to control the flow of a program based on multiple conditions.

javascript
let age = 25;
let hasLicense = true;

if (age >= 18 && hasLicense) {
    console.log("You can drive a car.");
} else {
    console.log("You cannot drive a car.");
}
// Output: "You can drive a car."
In this example, the condition age >= 18 && hasLicense checks if both conditions are true. If so, the message "You can drive a car." is logged.

Summary
&&: Logical AND, true if both conditions are true.

||: Logical OR, true if at least one condition is true.

!: Logical NOT, reverses the boolean value.

Logical operators are fundamental in making decisions in your code. If you have any further questions or need more examples, feel free to ask!
